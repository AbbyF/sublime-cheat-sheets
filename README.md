# Cheater Sublime Text 2 Plugin

Cheater is a plugin for quickly accessing cheat sheets in the Sublime Text 2 editor. Typing the key sequence will open a cheat sheet in a new file tab. If the sheet is already open, it will simply pop to the front.

## Available Cheat Sheets

At the moment there is only one available sheet.

* Regular Expressions (cmd/ctrl + shift + c + r + x)

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

New sheets, and improvements to the existing ones are more than welcome.

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, but do not mess with the Rakefile. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump the version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore it when I pull.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for git flow feature branches.
